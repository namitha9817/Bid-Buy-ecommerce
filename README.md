Design and development of a sophisticated online shopping website. Leveraging the power of the React framework, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, our primary goal was to create a secure and user-friendly platform for seamless online shopping experiences.
To fortify the website's security, particularly during payment transactions, we implemented a hybrid encryption approach utilizing both AES and RSA algorithms. This ensured a robust defense against potential security threats, providing users with a safe and trustworthy online store environment.
In our collaborative efforts, team discussions delved into project features and work distribution. I took charge of coding various integral components, including user sign-in/sign-up processes, the product display page, detailed product pages, the shopping cart, and inventory management.
In the realm of frontend development, I installed various npm packages to enhance the website's visual and interactive elements. Rigorous API testing using Postman was part of our quality assurance process, ensuring seamless communication between different components of the system.
For secure payment processing, we seamlessly integrated Braintree, facilitating smooth and secure transactions for both MasterCard and PayPal users. The result was a comprehensive online shopping solution that not only met but exceeded expectations, providing users with a secure, intuitive, and enjoyable shopping experience. üí≥üåêüõí #WebDevelopment #EcommerceSuccess"
